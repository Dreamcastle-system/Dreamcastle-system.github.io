title: How Time Flies
---
(Sketch)

Hello, I am Fettgo. Feeling glad to get access to this site again, i feel quite wistful to find how our system changed in these few days.

<!-- more -->

Last time we updated this site is on May with 12 alters, but now we are running with 400 alters. I dunno what caused that, however, it *isn't* a good news.

How time flies! I have experienced so much these days, not being able to describe them all. I think i should keep my beginning heart forever, as that is the way i should be.

To keep my beginning heart, that seems so frustruating and boring that being a new MtX and plural system host its quite difficult to stay all the same like before. However, I have thought that why i am so fascinating those days: I am quite aimful, without a certain aim to earn something, and I know to wait.

I think I should keep this habit. And move right on, now and then.

Fettgo
